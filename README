This is an attempt to port https://github.com/radar/forem as a Refinery plugin

requires refinery 0.9.9.9

add it to your gemfile

gem 'refinerycms-forem', :git => 'git@github.com:timuckun/refinerycms-forem.git'

bundle install

rails g  refinerycms_forem

rake db:migrate

That should get you going.
